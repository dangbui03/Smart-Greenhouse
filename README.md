# Smart-Greenhouse

## Introduction
Smart-Greenhouse is a model project of a system designed to automatically monitor and notify users of important metrics of crops in a smart greenhouse environment. The main goal of the project is to provide users with necessary information to efficiently maintain and manage crops, thereby increasing production efficiency and minimizing resource waste.

## Key Features
1. **Environmental Monitoring**: The system will automatically monitor factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and soil pH.
2. **Data Analysis**: Collected data will be analyzed to provide useful information about the health of crops.
3. **Automatic Notifications**: Users will receive notifications when there are significant changes in the greenhouse environment or crop health.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is friendly and easy to use, enabling users to easily track and manage information.

## How to Use
1. **Registration and Connection**: Users need to register an account and connect the system to sensors in the greenhouse.
2. **Monitor Information**: Users can access the interface to view information about environmental factors and crop health.
3. **Receive Notifications**: Users will receive notifications via email or app when there are significant changes in the environment or crop health.

## Benefits
- **Increased Efficiency**: By monitoring and adjusting the environment automatically, Smart-Greenhouse enhances the productivity and quality of crops.
- **Time and Effort Savings**: Users do not need to manually monitor every environmental factor, saving time and effort required for management.
- **Environmental Protection**: Efficient management of resources such as water and energy helps minimize waste and protect the environment.

## Development Directions
- **Feature Expansion**: Develop additional features such as automatic watering, pest control, and automatic fertilization.
- **Integration of Artificial Intelligence**: Use AI to predict and react to potential issues, providing optimal recommendations for users.
- **Social Interaction**: Integrate sharing and social connection features so users can share experiences and knowledge with the community.

## System Requirements
- Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light, soil pH)
- Internet connection
- User interface (mobile app or web)
